# Deployment Guide: Push to GitHub and Deploy on Render

## Step 1: Download Your Project

Since you're working in a WebContainer, you'll need to download the project files to your local machine:

1. **Download the project as a ZIP file:**
   - Look for a "Download" or "Export" button in your current environment
   - Or use the browser's download functionality if available

2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder on your computer

## Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

Open a terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Smart Temperature Logger full-stack app"
```

## Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it: `smart-temperature-logger`
5. Make it **Public** (required for free Render deployment)
6. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands like these (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-temperature-logger.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 5: Deploy on Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/log in
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
4. Select your `smart-temperature-logger` repository
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
6. Click "Deploy"

## What Happens During Deployment

- Render reads the `render.yaml` file
- Runs `npm install && npm run build` to build your React app
- Starts the server with `npm run server`
- Serves both frontend and backend on the same domain
- Handles WebSocket connections properly

## Environment Variables

The `render.yaml` file automatically sets:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (automatically assigned by Render)

## Post-Deployment

After deployment:
- Your app will be available at a URL like: `https://smart-temperature-logger-xxxx.onrender.com`
- The WebSocket connections will work seamlessly
- Temperature data will update in real-time
- CSV export will function properly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build fails**: Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. **WebSocket not connecting**: Ensure your app uses the production URL detection logic
3. **Static files not serving**: The `render.yaml` is configured to serve from `./dist`

## Making Updates

To update your deployed app:
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
   git push
   ```
3. Render will automatically redeploy
